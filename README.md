# SynLingo (Prototype)

**SynLingo** is a prototype web-based application designed to perform **real-time Indian Sign Language (ISL) hand gesture recognition** using a live webcam feed.  
The project aims to explore how artificial intelligence and computer vision can be used to improve accessibility and communication for the hearing- and speech-impaired community.

This project was developed as part of a **Class 11 Artificial Intelligence (AI) project**.

## 📌 Project Overview

SynLingo captures live video from a user’s webcam, extracts individual frames, and sends them to a **pretrained Roboflow computer vision model** for inference. The model predicts the corresponding ISL alphabet and displays the result in real time on a single-page static web application.

The application does **not require a backend server** and does **not use TensorFlow or OpenCV**, making it lightweight and easy to deploy for educational demonstrations.

## 🎯 Objectives

- To recognize ISL hand gestures in real time
- To demonstrate the integration of AI models with web technologies
- To build an accessible and easy-to-use prototype for sign language recognition
- To understand the practical application of computer vision in assistive technology

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – Frontend and UI
- **Web Camera API (MediaDevices)** – Access live webcam feed
- **HTML Canvas** – Capture video frames
- **Roboflow Universe** – Dataset sourcing
- **Roboflow Hosted Inference API** – Pretrained model deployment

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The browser accesses the user’s webcam using the MediaDevices API.
2. Live video frames are captured using an HTML canvas.
3. Each frame is converted into a base64-encoded image.
4. The image is sent to the Roboflow Hosted Inference API.
5. The AI model predicts the ISL hand sign.
6. The predicted class and confidence score are displayed on the webpage.

## 🚀 Future Developments

The current version of SynLingo is a prototype. Possible future enhancements include:

- Support for **full words and sentences**, not just alphabets
- Improved accuracy with a larger and more diverse dataset
- Real-time bounding box visualization for detected gestures
- Gesture-to-text and text-to-speech conversion
- Mobile-friendly and offline version using edge models
- Secure backend to protect API keys
- Multilingual sign language support

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Requires an internet connection for API-based inference
- API key is exposed in the frontend (acceptable for demos, not production)
- Accuracy depends on lighting conditions and hand positioning
- Limited to the gestures included in the training dataset
